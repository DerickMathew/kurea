Kurea [![Probably a passing build!](https://api.travis-ci.org/kellyirc/kurea.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kellyirc/kurea/)
=====

An IRC bot written for node.js in CoffeeScript, successor of [Vivio](https://github.com/seiyria/vivio), the Java IRC bot.

Installation
============
First, clone the repository. In the root of the repository, run `npm install` to get all of the dependencies.

Running the Bot
===============
For now, CoffeeScript is required to run Kurea. To install run `npm install -g coffee-script`.

First, make a copy of `config.json.sample` and call it `config.json`. Edit this to make the bot join your server/channels and give it any other configuration details necessary. Next, in the root of the repository, run `npm start`.

Running the Bot on a Server
===========================
It is recommended that you use [forever](https://npmjs.org/package/forever) to run the bot on a server. The bot periodically updates itself from this repository and if the core is updated, the bot will shutdown. Additionally, there are some problems in node-irc that will crash the bot. Forever helps ensure the bot remains running. You can run the bot with `forever start -c coffee Main.coffee`

Using MongoDB
=============
If you want to use MongoDB instead of nedb as your database engine, install MongoDB and set `config.storage = "mongo"`.

Developing the Bot
==================
Use `grunt dev` to manage linting the source and running unit tests. If you don't have grunt installed, run `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

Config options
==============
This group of options comes straight from irc.Client in [node-irc](https://github.com/martynsmith/node-irc). They're either self explanatory or explained in the [node-irc documentation](https://node-irc.readthedocs.org/en/latest/API.html#client).

```
	"apiKeys": {
		"wordnik": "GET YOUR OWN",
		"wolfram": "HAHA YOU WISH"
	}
}
```

Quiet Bot
=========
Is the bot too quiet? That means you have to turn on the modules. `!toggle all-on` will fix that.
